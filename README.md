# GardenBuddy

## The ultimate planner for the garden hobbyist!

Plan out where veggies and other plants will go in your garden with recommendations for companion plants, get reminders when it's time to plant/harvest, track your
watering schedule, and much more!

### **"Why a gardening app?" and my final vision for this project:**

I love gardening. It would be great to plan my plots out before the gardening season. It's helpful to know when I should
begin planting certain plants and to have reminders for when they should be watered.

At the end of this project, I hope to have a beautiful garden visualizer that can give me reminders for planting and
watering, as well as suggesting companion plants for the types of plants I decide to put in my garden this year.
